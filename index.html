            <p class="card">My name is Chris Villa! I was born on October 30th, 2003 and am currently 20 years old. I currently live in Long Beach, California in the United States. My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, going out with friends, and going out with friends. My dream job is to be a video game developer, so I hope to improve my coding skills during the bootcamp. Although I do enjoy playing video games on my own, I prefer to play with my friends. My favorite games to play with friends are Minecraft and Mariokart 8 Deluxe. </p>
